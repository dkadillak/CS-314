@pbrunner Now the model class takes in a File. I changed TripCo.java to show how that would work.

-Changed the location class so now a location accepts:
String Name, int ID, double Latitude, double Longitude, ArrayList Other

-Changed the Model class so most of parsing is done. Still need to convert Lat and Long, but other than that file input is going well.

-Still need to add tests for added methods in TestModel.java

errors in 
.gitignore
TripCo.class
