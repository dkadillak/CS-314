Personality Type: INFP

1. I expect my team to put in the effort to get all assignments done on schedule and I think we can accomplish doing very well on all group assignments. 

2. I want to be able to be able to dissect a task effectively and fairly and complete a task with someone who isn't right next to me. Effectively doing these two requires clear and precise communication.

3. People have personal lives, and I think that interfering with group work time could be an obstacle that my team and I encounter.

4. Those that want to get an "A" should by all means pursue the "A", and if that kind of behavior persists then those members who are working extra hard to get the better grade should be graded based on the version they put the extra time into, while the partner who is okay with the "B" should be graded on the version of the project he/she was satisfied with.

5. Absolutely it is. In a perfect world all team members would want to get the highest score possible, but a variety of factors can inhibit a member from putting in enough time to get the "A". Ultimately I believe anyone can get an "A", it just depends on how much time they want to put in to get that grade.

6. 7-10 hours.

7. First and foremost if someone is compelled for one reason or another to complete a certain task I say go for it, but other than that I think the group should discuss individual skill sets and assign tasks accordingly.

8. Communication is key. If a teammate doesn't follow through on a commitment, or doesn't show up, and doesn't communicate at all with the group about these things then I would give them one chance and talk to that individual member about it. If it happens again I would consult the instructor.

9. I would talk to an unbiased third party like say another group or gta to get their opinion.

10. With git we don't need to be in the same room at the same time all the time. With that in mind I think it would be okay for members to work according to their own habits, so long as we are meeting deadlines and are consistently communicating and meeting up to discuss progress and goals.

11. Absolutely I do. I think that this is essential.

12. The more the better but if we can get together 2-3 times a week including weekends that would be awesome.

13. Yeah as a general rule I would say so. If it becomes difficult to get a hold of everyone then I would say make as informed of a decision as possible and consult the other teammates when you can get a hold of them.

14.Find some sort of middle ground.

15. As often as is necessary for the group to function well. I would have to talk to my group but I would assume we would rotate if no one wants to be the facilitator, and if someone really wants to be the facilitator I say go for it.

16. Fight them. Just kidding, I would tell them that they seem to be dominating the team process, and I would remind them of the goals of this class.

17. Communicate to my teammates that I need help with facilitation responsibilities. If they are unresponsive I would consult the instructor.

18.Call me or text me, I'm free everyday after 5pm and I check my phone throughout the day.
