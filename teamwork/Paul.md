Paul Trapp
Personality type: INTP

1) Completing all assignments on time without a last minute rush and getting B's or higher

2) Allowing everyone to contribute equally. Not taking over and doing everything myself, as well as not giving up and doing the bare minimum to complete my share of the work.

3) Everyone will need to stay motivated and not get lazy

4) The people who want the A should be willing to do the extra work that entails. So each individual should do the amount of work appropriate for the grade they're aiming for without forcing more work on others. Within reason

5) Yes, but ideally everyone would agree to go for the A and do a roughly equal amount of work

6) anywhere from 2-6ish hours, depending on the difficulty of the task

7) Mostly decide on the fly. Each person can just pull the first thing they want to work on from the backlog, and ideally each person will end up doing their fair share

8) Talk it out, figure out what went wrong and make sure it doesnt happen again. If it becomes a persistent problem someone might have to involve the professor

9) Have to come to some kind of compromise

10) Each person will have to meet everyone else halfway to come to some kind of arrangment that works for everyone

11) Maybe. Not sure how this is all going to work yet

12) Twice a week or so

13) For big decisions yes

14) Try to come to a consensus. If that's not possible, eventually we'd just have to go with the majority

15) Maybe switch each project

16) Let them know and ask them to allow everyone to have an equal say

17) Ask the others to help me out

18) Text at pretty much any time
