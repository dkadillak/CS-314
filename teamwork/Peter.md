INFJ

1. I expect that my team will get the job done and will do excellent in this class.

2. My personal goals are just to develop better teamwork skills and be the best teammate I can be.

3. Some problems may be if I fall behind in my part or a teammate falls behind in their part.

4. If someone really wants to get an "A" and I don't care as much I will work harder to get the grade they're hoping for.

5. I'd say everyone should contribute to get an "A" one person shouldn't put in so much extra work as to get the entire project a letter grade higher.

6. Maybe 5-6 hours a week, just a total guess honestly.

7. I guess following the plans talked about in class to allocate work and speaking up about who wants to work on what part.

8. If someone doesn't follow through they should talk with the other group members and decide together what the best course of action is.

9. If people have different quality standards I think they should try to accommodate the other people in a way that is satisfactory to everyone.

10. I try to adapt to my team and do whatever role I need to because I don't have a preference.

11. Ya I think a meeting time outside of class would help a lot.

12. I think we should meet at least a couple times a week.

13. I plan on getting the approval of my teammates before I make a decently big decision to make sure we're all on the same page.

14. I think we shouldn't take action or make a decision unless everyone agrees, even if it takes a while to come to an agreement.

15. Maybe we could switch the facilitator role every assignment and go in an established order.

16. If one person is dominating the whole thing I think a group meeting to talk about better delegating aspects of the assignment would be a good idea.

17. If I feel most of the responsibilities are on me I will communicate that to my groupmates and ask for more help from them.

18. It's easiest to reach me by text on generally everyday except Sunday.
